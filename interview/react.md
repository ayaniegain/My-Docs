React JS Interview Questions
This document contains a comprehensive list of React JS interview questions to help you prepare for technical interviews. The questions cover fundamental concepts, advanced topics, and practical scenarios.
Basic Concepts

What is React JS?Explain React JS, its purpose, and why it is used for building user interfaces.

What is JSX?Describe JSX, how it differs from regular JavaScript, and how it is transpiled.

What is the difference between state and props?Explain the differences between state and props, including mutability, ownership, and management.

What is the Virtual DOM?Describe the Virtual DOM, how it works, and its role in React's reconciliation process.

What is reconciliation and the diffing algorithm in React?Explain how React's reconciliation process works and how the diffing algorithm optimizes updates.

Why should you use key as obj.id instead of index in lists?Discuss why using a unique obj.id is preferred over an index for the key prop in lists, and the impact on performance and correctness.

What is React.Fragment?Explain the purpose of React.Fragment and how it helps avoid unnecessary DOM elements.


Functional Components and Hooks

How do you define and use useState in a functional component?Describe how to use the useState hook and explain how it differs from normal variables in terms of reactivity and re-rendering.

What is useEffect and how does it work?Explain the purpose of the useEffect hook, including its dependency array and common use cases.

What is useEffect cleanup?Describe the cleanup function in useEffect, why it is needed, and provide an example (e.g., clearing timers or subscriptions).

How does the dependency array in useEffect work?Explain how the dependency array controls when useEffect runs and common pitfalls to avoid.

How do you render the previous value in useState?Discuss how to access or use the previous state value when updating state with useState.

What is useRef, and why doesn’t it trigger re-renders?Explain the useRef hook, its use cases (e.g., accessing DOM elements or storing mutable values), and why it doesn’t cause re-renders.

What is useReducer, and how does it work?Describe the useReducer hook, including the reducer function, initial state, state and action objects, and dispatch with type and payload.

What are custom hooks?Explain what custom hooks are, how to create them, and provide an example of a reusable custom hook.


Component Communication and Data Flow

How do you pass props in React?Explain how props are passed from parent to child components, including examples of different prop types.

What is props drilling, and how can it be avoided?Describe props drilling and solutions like useContext or state management libraries to mitigate it.

How do you pass data from a child to a parent component?Explain how to pass data from a child to a parent using callbacks or event handlers.

What is useContext, and how does it work?Describe the useContext hook, how to create a context, use a Provider, and consume context in components.

How do you pass children in React components?Explain the children prop, how it is used, and provide examples of rendering children in components.


Forms and Inputs

What are controlled components in React forms?Explain controlled components, how to manage form values with state, and provide an example.

How do you handle multiple inputs dynamically in a form?Describe how to manage multiple input fields, store their values in state, and update them dynamically.

What are the different types of forms in React?Discuss controlled vs. uncontrolled forms and their use cases.


Data Fetching and Rendering

How do you fetch data from a URL in React?Explain how to fetch data using fetch or axios in a React component, including handling loading and error states.

How do you render multiple UI elements based on state?Describe how to conditionally render UI components based on state changes, with examples.


Class Components

What are React class components?Explain class components, their structure, and how they differ from functional components.

What are the lifecycle methods in class-based components?Describe key lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount, etc.) and their use cases.


Advanced Topics

What is prop-types in React?Explain the prop-types library, its purpose, and how to use it for type-checking props.

What are nullish coalescing and optional chaining in JavaScript?Describe the nullish coalescing operator (??) and optional chaining (?.), and how they are used in React applications.


Additional Questions

What are the benefits of using React Hooks over class components?Discuss the advantages of hooks, such as simpler code, reusability, and avoiding complex lifecycle methods.

How do you optimize performance in a React application?Explain techniques like memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback), lazy loading, and code splitting.

What is the role of React.StrictMode?Describe React.StrictMode, its purpose, and how it helps identify potential issues in development.

How do you handle errors in React applications?Explain error boundaries, how to implement them, and their role in catching JavaScript errors.

What is the difference between useMemo and useCallback?Compare useMemo and useCallback, their use cases, and when to use each.

How does React handle event handling differently from vanilla JavaScript?Discuss React’s synthetic events, event delegation, and differences from native JavaScript event handling.
